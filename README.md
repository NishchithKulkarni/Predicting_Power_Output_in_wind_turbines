# Predicting_Power_Output_in_wind_turbines
The main objective of our project is to predict the wind power output generated based on the attributes given in the datasets which include wind speed, wind direction and constants.
Multiple linear regression model to build our project. Multiple linear regression is such a technique and the most commonly used short term prediction method, which will predict power output based on weather conditions. This method gives less prediction error.
